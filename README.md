# A quick web-app for improving text readability

Have you ever struggled with writing clear and concise text? Do you want to make your text more engaging and easy to read? If so, you might be interested in a quick web-app that can help you improve your text readability.

The web-app is called **Re**adable **T**ext **E**nhancer (RTE). It takes any text as input and gives back a better readable version of the text. The method it uses is to make the first syllables of a word **bold**. This way, the reader can quickly scan the text and identify the main words and ideas.

For example, if you input this text:

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

The web-app will output this text:

> **Mark**down is a light**weight** mark**up** lang**uage** that you can use to add form**atting** el**e**ments to plain**text** text doc**u**ments.

As you can see, the bolded syllables make the text more readable and emphasize the key terms. You can also adjust the level of bolding according to your preference.

The web-app is free and open-source, and you can access it online or download it from GitHub. It is a quick and handy tool for anyone who wants to improve their text readability and make their writing more appealing and effective.
